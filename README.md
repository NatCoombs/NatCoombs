- 👋 Hi, I’m @NatCoombs
- 👀 I’m interested in quantitative ecology, and generally employing more flexible, powerful tools to inform ecological theory. As datasets grow, tools and thought need to match. I'm currently a PhD student in Dan Reuman's lab at KU, where we tend to focus on aspects of synchrony.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some simple practical C++, a few patches of statistical theory and methodology here and there, and about various datasets!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on very little right now, but I'm always happy to hear about what other people are doing, and I know well enough that I'm no old hand at coding & software tools yet. Have a book, a paper, or a talk that really changed how you viewed things? Please send it to me!
- 📫 How to reach me: my institutional email is nat.coombs@ku.edu, and I have a (semi)professional Twitter at @coombs_nat!
